# WSL Notes

Just a compilation of notes for someone debugging WSL (Windows Subsystem Linux)
errors.

These particular methods were tried on WSL2 with Ubuntu.

## Installing WSL

For best results, use the instructions that Microsoft documents
[here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). Usually, we
would just use the Manual install instructions, unless you meet the requirements
to use the Simplified install instructions.

### Setting up WSL

Install whatever other applications you need on WSL based on Microsoft's
documentation:

* [VSCode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-vscode)
* [Git](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-git)
* [Databases](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-database)
* [Docker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-containers)

## Debugging Issues

From here, we'll go over some common errors you'll see with web development on
WSL.

### Localhost not connecting

Occasionally, servers running in WSL will not connect to Windows native
`http://localhost` address. Options to fix this problem include:

1. Finding the actual IP address WSL is running on to connect to that IP in your
   browser (or wherever) to have access to the WSL-run servers.

You can run the following command to find the IP address from within your WSL
environment:

```sh
ip addr | grep eth0
```

2. Shutting down the current running WSL environment to reset the connection to
   Windows's localhost.

In Powershell:
    1. Run `wsl --shutdown`
    2. Open a new instance of WSL
    3. Restart your database
        * For PostgreSQL on Ubuntu, run `sudo service postgresql start`
    4. Start your server and try to connect from Windows's localhost

You can optionally just restart your PC to restart WSL.

### Kill Run-Away Node Servers

Use the following command to kill any server that was left running when you
closed out of a terminal that was running it.

```sh
sudo kill -9 $(sudo lsof -t -i:«port_number»)
```

### `apt-get update` Release File not yet valid

Sometimes the clock in Ubuntu in WSL will drift away from the clock of your PC.
You can fix that by running:

```sh
sudo hwclock --hctosys
```
